└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why These Technologies?

**Gradio**: We chose Gradio because it lets us create beautiful, interactive web interfaces with pure Python. No need to juggle JavaScript frameworks or worry about frontend/backend communication - everything just works seamlessly.

**Async Python**: Modern web applications need to handle multiple users simultaneously without anyone having to wait. Our async implementation ensures smooth experiences even under load.

**OpenRouter + DeepSeek V3**: Instead of managing our own AI infrastructure, we leverage OpenRouter's platform to access state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek V3. This gives us enterprise-grade AI capabilities without the complexity.
