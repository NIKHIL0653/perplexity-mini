Web Search Module for AI Research Assistant

This module handles the web search functionality of our research assistant.
Think of it as the detective work part of our app - it goes out into the vast
internet to find the most relevant and up-to-date information about whatever
question you're curious about.

Right now, we're using mock data to demonstrate how the search would work,
but this can easily be swapped out for real search APIs like Brave Search,
SerpAPI, or Google Custom Search when you're ready to go live.

Features:
- Mock search results for demo purposes
- Intelligent keyword matching for different topics
- Structured data models for consistent results
- Easy integration with real search APIs
- Async support for smooth user experience
